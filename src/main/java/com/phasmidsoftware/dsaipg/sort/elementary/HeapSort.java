/**
 * Implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm for sorting an array of elements that implement the Comparable interface.
 * Heap Sort is an in-place, comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm consists of two main phases:
 * 1. Construction phase: The input array is transformed into a max-heap.
 * 2. Sort-down phase: The largest element is repeatedly removed from the heap and placed at the end of the array,
 * while the remaining heap is restored as a max-heap.
 * <p>
 * This class extends SortWithComparableHelper and provides specific sorting logic using the heap structure.
 *
 * @param <X> The type of the elements to be sorted, which must extend Comparable.
